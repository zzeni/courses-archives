                <h3>How my interest in web developing came?</h3>
                <p>There is no miracle behind this decision of mine. Like many of the people from my generation I graduated Economy just to be with the flow. After a short time, I recognize that this is not for me at all. The only thing that I found out that make sense and it is interesting for me was the Programming.</p>

                <h3>Why front-end?</h3>
                <p>At the beginning of my journey with the Programing, the things that I was able to partly understand was HTML and CSS. So I said to myself - ok let's start with this and make it work. What will happen after that, we'll see.</p>
