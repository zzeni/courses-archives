        <hr>
        <p> This is my first ever web page, that I create alone. This is my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nikolov.L">Facebook</a>, and you can add me to your friends if you'd like.</p>
        <p>I used to work for my father. He has a jewlery stores in Sofia. This is their web site - <a href="http://www.ugoman.eu">www.ugoman.eu</a></p>
        <p>I hope this is enought for now, and everything is written correctly! I can't wait to start creating full web sites with not only html, but with css too.</p>
        <p>Може текста да е и на кирилица!</p>
