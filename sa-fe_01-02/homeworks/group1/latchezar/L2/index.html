                <h2>Article 1</h2>
                <p> My name is Latchezar Nikolov, I am 22 years old. I was born andlive in Sofia. I have graduated the National Trade and Baning High School in Sofia. Currently i am studing in MTM College Sofia where i just finished my fifth semester.</p>
                <p> I do not work at the moment. I used to work for my father, who has few jewelry stores in Sofia. While I worked for him, I mainly worked on the web site he has. I used to upload the new products. I have not had any experience with html and css, but i was always interested in the way they work.</p>
                <p> I like fast cars, driving on the edge and over the speed limits. My car is my passion. I like watching Formula 1 races and the thrill of high speed.</p>
