                                    Car camping with family or friends is a summer pastime for many of us. Whether the campground itself is the main attraction or it's simply your base camp for nearby activities, this article will help you find the right camping tent—your home away from home.

                                <h3>Tent Sleeping Capacity</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When choosing your tent, first choose a model based on your group's size and whether or not you might need additional space for extra friends, gear or dogs. Keep in mind, however, that no industry standard exists that defines per-person tent dimensions. When evaluating tent capacity ratings, our general advice is this: Assume a close fit. If you seek more room, consider upsizing your tent capacity by 1 person, particularly if you or your usual tent companion(s).

                                <h3>3-Season Tents</h3>
                                <p>
                                    By far the most popular choice of tents, 3-season tents are lightweight shelters designed for the relatively temperate conditions of spring, summer and fall. They are usually equipped with ample mesh panels to boost air flow. Mesh panels keep out insects (but can still let in powdery blowing sand). Properly pitched with a taut rainfly, 3-season tents can withstand downpours but are not the best choice for sustained exposure to harsh storms, violent winds or heavy snow.
                                </p>
                                <h3>3- 4-Season Tents</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Extended-season (3+ season) tents are engineered for prolonged 3-season usage, suitable for summer use but also trips in early spring and late fall when moderate snow may be encountered. Their goal: offer a balance of ventilation, strength and warmth-retention.

Typically they include 1 or 2 more poles and fewer mesh panels than pure 3-season models. This makes them sturdier and warmer than their 3-season cousins. Extended-season tents are a good choice for those who make frequent trips to exposed, high-elevation destinations. While very sturdy, they are not as fully fortified for harsh winter weather as 4-season tents.
                                </p>
                                <h3>4-Season Tents</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Engineered to withstand fierce winds and substantial snow loads, mountaineering tents can be used in any season. Their chief function, though, is to stand firm in the face of seriously inhospitable weather, principally in winter or above treeline.

They use more poles and heavier fabrics than 3-season tents. Their rounded dome designs eliminate flat roof spaces where snow can collect. They offer few mesh panels and rainflies that extend close to the ground. This hinders ventilation and can make them feel warm and stuffy in mild weather. But when foul winds begin to howl, a 4-season tent provides a reassuring place of refuge.

                                    Camping may seem like a perfect way to get in tune with nature, but it is often not as tranquil as it should be.
Most who have spent the night in a tent have woken up in the early hours of the morning shivering with cold, or been rudely jolted from their sleep by the voices from the tent next door.
But now Thermo Tents is offering a solution – insulation.
                                </p>
                                <p>It claims the insulation can also help to block out noise, meaning campers can avoid being woken early by the sounds of screaming children and could prove a hit at festivals.
The idea was dreamt up by inventor Derek O’Sullivan, 38, from Fenit near Talee in Ireland, after spending sleepless nights in the cold while camping with his young family.
He said: ‘I was camping in Snowdonia with my wife Julie and had awoken, freezing in my tent, for the umpteenth time.
‘I sat up and said “enough”. The following morning I started sketching a tent that would keep us comfy - and Thermo Tent was born.
‘From those sketches, we have developed the world's only correctly thermally and acoustically insulated tent. 
‘Essentially our tents are warmer in the cold times, cooler in the hot times and all noise is muffled, in and out.
‘Thermo Tent is the result of marrying brand new and innovative insulation technology with our new multi layer tent design.’
Thermo Tents use a similar waterproof outer as standard tents but the interior uses a padded insulation material that attaches to the poles.
The tents come in a range of sizes from three-person to six-person tents, which feature a porch and windows.
Using lightweight materials the firm has managed to reduce the weight and size of the tent.</p>
                                <h3>How the termo tent works</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The Thermo Tents use a similar waterproof outer as standard tents but the interior uses a padded insulation material that attaches to the poles. They also come with a carpet. Sizes range from three-person to six-person tents, which feature a porch and windows. Using lightweight materials the firm has reduce the weight and size of the tent. Thermo Tent is also hoping to produce a version that can be sent to disaster zones - and is sending a batch of Thermo Tents to to Nepal to help with the aid crisis following the recent earthquake. But unlike many other tents, which are often built for their lightweight design, the insulation makes the packed size of the tents are likely to be larger than others on the market.

                                   There's nothing better than spending a few days in the wilderness. Except for the fact that there's no WiFi, television, kitchen, quesadillas, electricity, bathrooms or stereo systems. With the rise of ridiculous tech that nobody needs and our over-connected lifestyles, glamping has unfortunately become a normal experience for outdoor enthusiasts looking to get away but not actually.
                                    So, naturally, glampers have a ton of ridiculous, over-the-top and unnecessary products to make their outing as comfortable as possible.

                    <h2>Tips when choosing a tent</h2>
                    <hr class="small">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            <div class="portfolio-item">
                                <p>1. Look in the flesh - If you havent got a clue where to start, try and look at as many tents in the flesh, find a show or a large tent retail outlet which has many different types of tents erected</p>
                                <p>2. How transporting? – look at the packed size (and weight if you are carrying this) as well as the pitch size – some of these can be real space eaters in your boot. You might need a trailer, top box or even a new new car!</p>
                                <p>3. Inside height – unless you are hiking and saving weight, there is little reason to get a tent where you are on your knees at the time. Standing up in a tent is a must really if you are going to spend a bit of time in it. So check your height and the "inner" height of the tent (not the outer figures sometimes quoted). Some tents have lower heights for the bedrooms, which is fine unless you do want standing height all the way through.</p>
                                <p>4. Size of bedrooms – ignore the number of berths suggested by the manufacturer, as they base it on very narrow hiking mats. If you want some comfort, then calculate your own requirements based on a width of a std air bed being approx 80cm and a double being 140cm. This quickly leads to you realising that a "4 berth" tent is actually more suitable for 2/3 people and an "8 berth" for 4-6 (depending on the make and model).</p>
                                <p>5. Bedroom placement - do you want the bedrooms adjacent or separated. Separated gives you a bit more privacy; which is useful with older kids or other couples for example. Adjacent (usually separated by thin material with a zip or not) works well with younger children, as getting out in the middle of the night to get to crying children, through 2-3 sets of zips, and across the middle of the tent with chairs etc in the way, can be a right pain!</p>
                                <p>6. Inside space if raining – when you see the tent in the flesh, shut the door and ask yourself what would it be like in here if it was raining? (Preferably go to the shop when it is, there will be less people). Some tents can be claustrophobic or just too small to sit around a table and play games. Also look to see if it the tent has a canopy, or the door(s) can be used as a canopy, which could be left open in a shower – again a good way not to feel trapped in a tent. Not a big issue for a weekend tent - you can always nip down the pub; but could get to you for longer week holidays.</p>
                                <p>7. Cooking – same as above, go inside and ask "where am I going to cook?". Cooking in tents obviously has to be done carefully; especially in synthetic/nylon tents (canvas/cotton is a bit easier). It is why a good sized porch or a separate day-tent can be a godsend. Again, not a big problem for weekend camping, but more important for weeks away.</p>
                                <p>8. Space for storage – don’t forget to think "where am I going to store my things…?". Extra bedrooms or alcoves can be very useful for keeping items/clothes etc. out of the way.</p>
                                <p>9. Pitch size – some of these tents can pitch over a massive spread, which can make them a bit of pain to pitch; but more importantly, not accepted at some sites - thankfully still the minority of sites, but it is till worth checking. 7x7m is a good rule of thumb, spread bigger and you will need to ask before turning up.</p>
                                <p>10. Pitch Solo or not – how many people will be pitching the tent. Always find out how many it takes. Some tents can be easily pitched by one person; others need 2, possibly 3. Although there might be two of you, who will be looking after the kids at the time? Some tents, although more expensive, are specifically designed to be pitched solo, fast and with the minimum of effort, so look out for these if it is a big requirement for you. Generally, modern day tents are not that difficult, some can just take more time, so don’t worry about how they pitch, just the number of people required.</p>
                                <p>11. Pitch inner or outer first – depending on how the tent is designed it will either pitch inner-first or outer-first (sometimes also called "pitching as one"). Inner-first means that if it is raining it is harder to keep the inside section dry; outer-first (the flysheet) obviously gives more protection with the rain. Outer-first is, therefore, more desirable in most peoples’ opinion, especially with big tents where there could be longer with the inner-exposed to the weather. It tends to be less of an issue with smaller tents, as they can be pitched quickly or with a lose flysheet over them for temporary cover. </p>
                                <p>12. HH – the level of water resistance/"proofing", usually for nylon/synthetic tents, is rated in "HH" figures – HH 3000, HH 2000 etc (note: this tends not to be used for cotton/canvas tents as their water resistance principal is different). There is always debate on the minimum requirement, but really it depends on the climate you are expecting and how it is going to be used. The army are happy to use small field tents with a low figure of 800HH, but they have a different purpose in mind. Generally stick to anything above 1500HH and you will be fine. Also don’t get confused between the rating of the groundsheet (which is usually very high – as it sits on the ground) and the flysheet. It is the flysheet that you need to check. Most reliable make UK tents are 2000HH and above, so there is little to worry about; however, some import tents from hotter climates are rated less well and could just get you wet in the middle of the night! </p>
                                <p>13. To SIG or not to SIG – Virtually all bedroom pods have the groundsheet connected to the sides of the compartment, to keep bugs and draughts out while you are sleeping. With some tents this is extended to include the living area as well, and sometimes the whole tent – this is generally referred to as a sewn-in-groundsheet (SIG). The alternative is a living area, where the groundsheet is lose/removable – potentially not as effective against the elements (but there are ways to make them very cosy), it is easier to be cleaned. There are also groundsheets that have the best of both worlds and can be zipped out. In the end, it is preference thing with each type of tent - there is a lot on the forum on pros and cons of SIGs, so it is worth reading the various views.</p>
                                <p>14. Storm or mud flaps – where the flysheet is not connected to the groundsheet it leaves a gap with the ground – which can be good for ventilation for some tents; however, it can also be draughty (in non-SIG tents). Good/big mud flaps, also called storm flaps, can be tucked back inside and under the groundsheet jutting out the elements. Poor quality/cheap tents, or where there is a specific need to save weight, tend to leave such flaps off – hence, it is worth checking if a tent has them or not; especially if it is a non SIG tent. </p>
                                <p>15. Porches, dogs & prams – a porch is a very invaluable feature if you want to keep muddy/wet pets and items, like prams, out of the main dry and clean tent. Porches tend to have removable groundsheets (not SIG), so can be easily taken out and cleaned or just left out.</p>

                    <h2>5 Tips for Buying Family Camping Tents</h2>

                        <div class="col-md-12">

                                    Buying a family camping tent is like buying a vehicle: You should think about your family's needs and wants.
When it comes to vehicles, if you're going to be hauling children and their gear, you go for the minivan or SUV rather than the small, sporty car.
With tents, if you'll be backpacking your equipment long distances, you'll need the lightest-weight tent that will still protect you from the elements. You might choose one- or two-person tents, and let each camper carry his or her own shelter.
But if you're driving to within a few yards of where you'll pitch your tent, and you want adults and children together, then you want a family camping tent.
Then, other questions arise. Will you be camping only during the summer? If so, you will be interested in a tent with plenty of mesh windows and vents. Most tents are made of some combination of mesh and nylon or polyester, with different combinations for different seasons.
Are you more interested in having an inexpensive place to stay near vacation destinations, or in having a back-to-nature experience? Will you break camp frequently and drive to new destinations, or will you pitch the tent once and spend the whole vacation there? The answers to such questions might help you decide whether you're more interested in how easy the tent is to pitch or in how spacious it will be.
Even if you're likely to use the tent only once a year, it's important to choose one that will make camping a pleasure for the whole family. Read on to learn more about your choices.
