            <h3>Project "Soldier"</h3>
            <p>I have often told you stories about the way I lived the life of a drifter waiting for the day. When I'd take your hand and sing you songs then maybe you would say "Come lay with me and love me" and I would surely stay. But I feel I'm growing older. And the songs that I have sung Echo in the distance Like the sound Of a windmill going round Guess I'll always be A soldier of fortune.</p>

            <h3>Project "Fortune"</h3>
            <p>Many times I've been a traveler I looked for something new. In days of old when nights were cold I wandered without you. But those days I thought my eyes Had seen you standing near. Though blindness is confusing It shows that you're not here. Now I feel I'm going older And the songs that I have sung Echo in the distance Like the sound Of a windmill going round Guess I'll always be A soldier of fortune. Like the sound Of a windmill going round Guess I'll always be A soldier of fortune.</p>

            <h3>Project "Wherever"</h3>
            <p>And the road becomes my bride. I have stripped of all but pride. So in her I do confide and she keeps me satisfied Gives me all I need...and with dust in throat I crave. Only knowledge will I save. To the game you stay a slave. Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond - call me what you will. But I'll take my time anywhere. Free to speak my mind anywhere. And I'll redefine anywhere. Anywhere I roam. Where I lay my head is home.</p>
