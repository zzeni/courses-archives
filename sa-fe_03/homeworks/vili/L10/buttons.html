                    <p> My name is John Hall and I'm a prefessional photographer.I have high quality equipment.I have fast, high-quality lenses. I do not use the little pop-up flash on my cameras. I have real flashes.My flash cost more than most cameras.I have almost 30 years of experience.I do this job because I love it. Not because it's my second, part-time job.My tripod cost more than most cameras.My camera case cost more than most cameras.I have high power computers with state of the art software.I go out to photograph an event with $8,000-$10,000 worth of equipment.This is how I make my living.I have insurance.I pay taxes. I am licensed by the state.I have a studio that we can meet in.I have back-up equipment.I have samples from dozens of wedding for you to see.I can produce a professional album for you.I know how to use the controls on my camera and not just program.I am an innovator, not a follower.I believe my work has value and I refuse to accept less!!</p>

                    <br> Sorry for this little rant, but I am tired of being compared to others with low quality gear and no experience and no overhead calling themselves the same professional quality as me!
