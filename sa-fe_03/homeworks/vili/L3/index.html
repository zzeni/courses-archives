  <h1>WELCOME TO OUR WEBPAGE !<h1>

<p>There are real live people standing behind everything we manage to achieve. 
For every rescued, every healed, every rehomed little pet, there are kind-hearted 
people who have given their best to succeed.</p>
<p>Our cause has many supporters. Many 
opponents as well. We thank you for being here. Because nothing would work if it was
not for each of us coming to a point where we realise: I want to help and I will. 
Here. Today. Me.The Bulgarian reality will be as we make it. We have created Animal
Rescue Sofia to work on the humane and proffecional solution to the stray dog 
population in the country. We are here to help. We are here to save lives.</p>
